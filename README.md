# Invisible-Cloak
It is something interesting and magical made using computer vision. I hope you all know about Harry Potter’s ‘invisible cloak’, the one he uses to become invisible. We will see how we can do the same magic trick with the help of computer vision. I have written the code with python and used the opencv library.
